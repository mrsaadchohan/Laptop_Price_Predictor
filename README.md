# Laptop Price Predictor

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the price of laptops based on various features such as brand, RAM, GPU, and other specifications.
It provides a user-friendly interface for predicting laptop prices, making it useful for both consumers and retailers.

## Features
* Dataset: The dataset includes information about various laptops, such as their specifications and prices.
* Algorithms: The model uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict laptop prices.
* Preprocessing: The data undergoes preprocessing such as encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.
* Model Performance: The model is evaluated using metrics like R² score on training and test data.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on the R² score, and the final results are displayed as:
Training R²: 0.8644
Testing R²: 0.8219
